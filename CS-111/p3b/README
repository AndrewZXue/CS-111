This project is written with python

This tarball contains 3 files:
lab3b.py: the source file of this program
Makefile: the makefile of the program
README: this file

lab3b.py: 
	takes in a file system (described by a .csv file), detects and print out the inconsistency.
	data structures used: mainly dictionaries and lists

	privilege of dictionaries: easy to keep track of the data - match the label with data
	Some 2d dictionaries are used as an array of dictionaries

	privilege of list: when I try to define if a piece of data exists in a group, 
	I prefer lists. (No need to match label with data)

Makefile:
	contains 3 targets:
	default: create lab3b based on lab3b.py
	clean: clean generated files
	dist: create the tarball file
