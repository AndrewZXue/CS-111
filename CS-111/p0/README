Smoke Test Specification

In the check target of Makefile, 6 test cases are included.
They are, respectively:
	functionality test
	input test
	invalid argument test
	non-existing input file test
	unopenable output file test
	SIGSEGV test
-> functaionality test tests the overall functionality of the program
	comparing the contents of input and output to make sure copy is done correctly
	(correctly implements output and combined -- value feature)
-> input test makes sure the input part of the program works out
	(correctly implements input -- value feature)
-> invalid argument test is corresponding to exit value 1,
	making sure undefined argument is correctly handled
-> non-existing input file test makes sure the program's feature of
	"correctly handling of non-exisiting input file"
-> unopenable output file test makes sure the program's feature of
	"correctly handling of un-openable/creatable output file"
-> SIGSEGV test makes sure segmentaional fault is caught and reported correctly
