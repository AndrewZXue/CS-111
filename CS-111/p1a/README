This tarball file contains three files.

-------------------------------------------------------
lab1a.c contains my source code. It includes three functions and a main function.
reset_input_mode restores the default terminal mode.
set_input_mode stores the current terminal mode, and sets it to non-canonical mode
sig_handler handles certain signals potentially occur in the program

main function judges the option of the command and responds respectively.
Three mapping strategies are designed for three differnet situations: normal read and write, read(from 0) and write with shell, and read(from shell) and write with shell.

The source code is commented for detailed understanding.

---------------------------------------------------------
Makefile has three targets: all, clean, and dist
all: compile lab1a.c
clean: remove any file constructed through Makefile
dist: create the required tarball
