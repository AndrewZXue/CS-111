This Tarball contians 3 files. Four source files: lab1b-client.c, lab1b-service.c, and Makefile;
1 my.key file used for encryption and decryption;
and this README file.

lab1b-clinet.c
This file is in charge of
1. setting and restoring terminal mode
	set_input_mode()
	reset_input_mode()
2. setup socket to reach the server
	at the beginnig of main()
3. collecting input from the keyboard, and sending it to the server through socket
	main()
4. encrypt and decrypt the data for socket transportation
	encryption_init()
5. display the output from server

lab1b-server.c
This file is in charge of 
1. accepting connection request of client
	at the beginning of main -- accept() & bind()
2. parent and child process to run a shell
	same feature as lab1a
3. encryption and decryption
	encryption_init()
4. signal handling
	sig_handler()
	NOTE that the signal and exit status are output on the server side
	the cliend should not know the reason of exit/error
!!!!NOTE: the server should never set terminal modes
	I included the set_input_mode() and reset_input_mode() in the server at first, and was stuck on the shell test for hours. Everything was solved after removing these functions from the server.

Makefile
all: compile lab1b-client.c and lab1b-server.c
clean: clean all products of compilation
dist: make the tarball

my.key
contains my 16-bit key to encryption
